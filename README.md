- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @API-LLC  John Nash, aka Kubulai, at American Programmers Independent, LLC.   
- My CV can be read at https://alt-fw.org/public/?page_id=276 or https://jdnash.com/curriculum-vitae/. 
- My distinguishing attribute is that I take the tasks that no one can see a way to solve and work through them. My solutions are usually elegant 
but rarely rushed. I distain throwing a poorly designed board into the system and then adding cuts and jumpers in production: I make the board right the
first time through careful development so production costs are minimized. I build procedures rather than follow other people's production processes. 
- I am NOT ready to just drop in and contribute to a major FOSS project. 
 
- My background is in AeroSpace Embedded Systems, mostly macro assembler, and I enjoy coding for Raspberry PI, TI LaunchPads, or Arduino. 
- Currently I use html5, css3, php in serving my customers, but I have also used pascal and C++ and of course I hack my way through BASH just to manage my Mint/MATE desktop. I am generally alergic to javascript, java, and the like because the syntax is non-intuitive to me. My preferred editor is BlueFish.
- I need to update my skills for current processor generations but have past experience in small Motorola, Texas Instruments, and Intel. 

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in ModernAuth capable GNU/Linux email clients or development
- ðŸ‘€ I'm interested in connecting some of my micros via TAG to eliminate the bootloader software
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning GitHub
- ðŸ“« How to reach me email to Promotions@jdnash.com. No spam please. No offers to sell me websites. Or extended waranties on my car. Thank-you.
